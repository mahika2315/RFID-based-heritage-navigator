RFID Heritage Navigator

An interactive RFID-based system designed to enhance visitor experiences at cultural and historical sites by providing personalized, accurate, and engaging information about sculptures and artifacts.

üìú Project Overview

Cultural heritage sites often face challenges in delivering consistent and engaging information to visitors. Traditional guides and static signage can lead to incomplete or inconsistent details. The RFID Heritage Navigator leverages RFID technology and an interactive graphical interface to provide a reliable, user-friendly, and immersive self-guided tour experience.
The project was developed with a focus on the Beluru Chennakeshava Temple and aims to improve cultural preservation, accessibility, and visitor engagement.

üéØ Objectives

Provide accurate, context-rich information about artifacts.

Enable self-paced, interactive exploration of cultural sites.

Simplify navigation within heritage sites using interactive maps.

Digitally preserve cultural and historical knowledge.

Ensure scalability for use at other heritage locations.
